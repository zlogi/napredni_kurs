            </div>
            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Hope. Fear. Excitement. Traveling for the first time produced a wave of emotions.</p>
                <p>When I left to travel the world on my first round-the-world trip, I didn’t know what to expect. Now, with fifteen years of travel experience under my belt, I know better. Traveling is second nature to me now. I land in an airport and I just go on autopilot.</p>
                <p>But, back then, I was as green as they come. To compensate for my lack of experience, I followed my guidebooks and wet my feet by going on organized tours. I was young and inexperienced and I made a lot of rookie travel mistakes.</p>
                <p>I know what it’s like to just be starting out and have a mind filled with questions, anxieties, and concerns. So, if you’re new to travel and looking for advice to help you prepare, here are 12 tips that I’d tell a new traveler to help them avoid some of my early mistakes:</p> <br>
                <h2>1. Don't be scared</h2><br>
                <p>Fear is a powerful deterrent. Taking the leap into the unknown is scary, but remember: you aren’t the first person to travel the world. You aren’t discovering new continents or exploring uncharted territories.</p>
                <p>There is a well-worn travel trail out there and people to help guide you along the way. If millions of people can make their way around the world each year, you can too. You’re just as capable as anyone else. After all, you did the hardest part: deciding to go. Having the courage to make that decision is the hardest part.</p>
                <p>You’ll make mistakes. Everyone does. But that’s part of the experience. There will be lots of people out there to help you. You’ll be shocked at just how helpful and kind people are. You’ll make friends, you’ll survive, and you’ll be better for it.</p><br>
                <h2>2. Don’t Live by Your Guidebook</h2><br>
                <p>Guidebooks are useful for a general overview of a destination. They’re a great way to learn the basics and get introduced to the cities and countries you plan to visit. But you’ll never find the latest off-the-beaten-path attractions, bars, or restaurants in them.</p>
                <p>For the latest info (as well as insider tips), connect with locals. Use websites like Meetup.com or Couchsurfing to connect directly with local and expats so you can get suggesitons, advice, and tips to make the most of your trip. Additionally, ask other travelers you meet or the staff at your hotel/hostel. Visit the local tourist board as well. It’s a wealth of information that often gets overlooked.</p>
                <p>In short, use a guidebook for the foundation of your plans but fill in the details with up-to-date info from locals. You can also use travel blogs for planning tips since they are updated more often than guidebooks.</p><br>
                <h2>3. Travel Slow</h2><br>
                <p>This is something most new long-term travelers learn the hard way (myself included). I know it can be tempting to pack in as many cities and activities as possible. (This is especially true if you only have a few weeks of vacation.)</p>
                <p>But rushing from city to city every other day is just going to leave you exhausted and stressed out. You’ll experience a whirlwind of activity, most of which will remain a blur when you look back on it. Sure, you’ll have some great pictures for Instagram but is that really why you’re traveling? Travel is about quality, not quantity. Don’t worry about how much you see. Don’t worry about trying to impress people with the number of countries you’ve visited. Slow down and soak up your destinations. You’ll learn more, enjoy it more, and have a much more memorable experience.</p> <br>
                <h2>4. Pack Light</h2><br>
                <p>When I went to Costa Rica in 2003, I brought a bag filled with tons of stuff: hiking boots and pants, a fleece jacket, too much clothing, and my bodyweight in toiletries. And it all sat in my bag, mostly unused. I was packing for “just in case” and “what if” instead of the reality of my trip.</p>
                <p>While it can be tempting to bring more than you need “just in case,” remember this: you can buy things on the road. Socks, shampoo, jackets, new shoes — you can find it all aborad. There’s no need to bring everything and the kitchen sink. So, pack light. You’ll have less to carry, saving you the hassle and stress of lugging a huge backpack around for weeks (or months) on end.</p>
                <p>Unless you are going somewhere cold, a bag around 40 liters will suffice. Bags around this size are easier to carry, don’t get too unwieldy, and can fit on your flight as carry-on only if need be (a huge perk if you want to save yourself some headaches).</p> <br>
                <h2>5. Get Travel Insurance</h2><br>
                <p>Whether you’re a travel veteran or a brand new backpacker, don’t leave home without making sure you’re protected in case something goes wrong. As we learned during the COVID-19 pandemic, sudden emergencies can come out of nowhere. I’ve had my luggage lost. I popped an eardrum in Thailand. I was knifed in Colombia.</p>
                <p>I’ve had a friend break bones, need to be helicoptered out of the Amazon, or fly back due to a sudden death. Stuff happens. To ensure you’re protected, buy travel insurance. I never leave home without it because I know just how quickly things can go sideways.</p>
                <p>You never know what might happen. The road is filled with uncertainty. Make sure you’re protected. It will also give you peace of mind and help you travel with confidence.</p><br>
                <h2>6. Bring a Phone (and Get Local SIM Cards)</h2><br>
                <p>Having a phone with data means you can look up directions on the fly, make reservations, and contact emergency services if something happens. Sure, there is free wifi pretty much everywhere these days so buying a local SIM card for data might seem like a waste of money (especially if you’re on a really, really tight budget) but having that immediate access to roaming data can be a lifesaver.</p>
                <p>If you’re from the US and traveling for less than 3 months, T-Mobile has reliable data plans. Google Fi is another great option too. Additionally, having a phone makes it easier to connect and stay in touch with travelers you meet. Simply put: having a phone is really helpful in this day and age.</p><br>
