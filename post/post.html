                <p>As a history nerd, I love taking a deep dive into a destination’s past. I’m a firm believer that if you don’t understand where people have come from, you’ll never understand where they are now. It’s a big reason why I love museums so much.</p>
                <p>First settled by the Dutch as “New Amsterdam,” the Dutch the city surrendered to the English in 1664. The city was a major trading center located at the mouth of the Hudson River. After the Revolution, New York was the hub of America’s power and government, officially becoming the nation’s capital in 1789 when George Washington was sworn in. While it’s no longer the nation’s capital (it moved to Philadelphia the following year and then to Washington, DC in 1800), NYC was still the beating heart of the country.</p>
                <p>Since I love adding “themes” to my travels, a great theme for your visit to New York is colonial history – and much of the city’s colonial history is still present today. Most of the sights are located in the financial district (one of the most underappreciated parts of NYC), so it’s easy to visit everything in a day. Here’s what to see:</p> <br>
                <h2>1. The Battery:</h2><br>

                <p>Located on the southern tip of Manhattan, this park is where the Dutch built Fort Amsterdam in 1625 to defend their settlement. The British took the area over in 1664 and eventually renamed it Fort George. The fort’s cannon battery wasn’t used until 1776 when American forces took it over after declaring independence. While the fort was mostly destroyed during the Revolution, the battery was expanded after the war’s end.</p>
                <p>Today, there are over 20 monuments and plaques in the park, covering everything from the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812 to immigration and much more. You can wander around the fort and then stroll through the surrounding park and take in the beautiful waterfront views of the harbor, the Statue of Liberty, and Ellis Island.</p> <br>
                <h2>2. Fraunces Tavern</h2><br>

                <p>This is the oldest bar in New York City, having been converted from a home (built in 1719) to a tavern in 1762. Prior to the Revolution, the Sons of Liberty (a secret anti-British organization founded by Samuel Adams) would meet here to discuss their plans and philosophies.</p>
                <p>During the war, the building was damaged when Alexander Hamilton stole British artillery, provoking a response from the British navy than sent a cannonball through the roof. After the war, George Washington said farewell to his officers and troops of the Continental Army here.</p>
                <p>Today, on the first floor, there’s a pretty decent restaurant (slightly overpriced though) and a bar with a great selection of draft beers. The tavern also hosts historical talks, as well as events like trivia nights. It is also home to a small museum on the second floor, which includes all kinds of historical documents and objects. For the 300th anniversary of the building’s construction in 2019, a new exhibition chronicling its history was created to highlight the pivotal events that took place here.</p> <br>
                <h2>3. Bowling Green</h2> <br>

                <p>This public park is the oldest in NYC. During colonial times, the British installed a 4,000-pound gilded lead statue of King George III on horseback. It was repeatedly vandalized leading up to the war, forcing the British to build a fence around the park (the one that still stands today) and create anti-vandalism laws</p>
                <p>After the Declaration of Independence was read in 1776, the statue was toppled and dismembered. The head, allegedly, was mailed to England. The body, so the story goes, was melted down into bullets for the Continental Army. Today, the area remains a park and there’s a plaque on the fence with a brief historical overview.</p> <br>
                <h2>4. City Hall Park</h2><br>
                <figure>

                <p>This park is where New Yorkers held rallies both before and during the Revolutionary War, including a rally against the Stamp Act in 1765. When the Act was repealed the following year, a new flagpole was built here — known as the Liberty Pole — which waved a flag that said “Liberty.” People also gathered here to hear Washington read the Declaration of Independence in 1776; the spot is marked by a plaque from 1892 (another marks the location of the Liberty Pole).</p>
                <p>During the war, the British converted it into a prison to hold American prisoners of war, where over 250 Americans were executed. In 1783, when the war was won, Washington raised an American flag over the park. Nowadays, it’s a pretty park with a fountain and benches to relax on. You’ll see a lot of people here during lunch. (Well, at least you did pre-COVID.)</p> <br>
                <h2>Bonus Sites</h2> <br>
                <p>On Staten Island, you’ll find The Conference House, where Ben Franklin led a peace delegation in 1776 (it failed). The house has been refurbished and does events throughout the year. It’s open now by private booking.</p>
                <p>On the corner of Pearl and Broad, you’ll find the brick outline of Stadt Huys, the first city hall as well some glass portals that look down to remnants of the colonial city that were found in the 1970s</p>
                <p>You’ll also find bricks that show you where the old shoreline used to be during colonial days. (Everything from Broad down is landfill designed to expand the city as it became a bigger and bigger shipping hub.)</p>
